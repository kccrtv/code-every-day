# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 6, 2021 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Committing to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Let's get it!!

**Thoughts**: One hundred days does seem pretty daunting, especially since life is in so much flux right now, but like any muscle to flex -- this will be all worth it in the end. Python, who? I don't know her. But I will!

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
