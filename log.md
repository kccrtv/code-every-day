# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React, Material UI, Firebase

**Thoughts**: Still a little new to useContext and how it ties into the puzzle pieces of my app. Setting up an auth context was easy enough, but I think my minor blocker with my fave context is that I haven't set up my components to pull data from the JSON object and so I can't set up a fave array because there isn't data to gather!

### Day 15: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React, Firebase, Material UI

**Thoughts**: When I was a UX Designer, Sketch app was all that was standard, now templates like Google's Material UI Design System require a few lines/pages of code to render beautifully responsive components like forms or navigation bars. On another note, Firebase auth took only a few hours to get set up in my capstone app. This makes me at MVP, and it's only Tuesday! I'm one step closer to playing around with TensorFlow or GestureAI! So stoked.

### Day 14: April 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React, Firebase

**Thoughts**: Again, shoutout to the fantastic people who make tutorials (for free!). Today I'm kicking off the official Project 4 capstone week learning about Firebase and how it will streamline user authentication into my app.

### Day 13: April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React

**Thoughts**: I have been determined to do a light and dark mode in every project, but ran out of time and sanity to do so. This time around I took some time to learn theming in React today, and four js screens and a json schema later, we have light and dark mode, y'all!

### Day 12: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Storybook.js

**Thoughts**: Even though most of us are proceeding with our final projects independently, my classmates and I find excuses to chat with each other and help one another out. I helped my colleague working in Storybook.js do some bug hunting, and it was a learning process for the both of us, since this UI framework is unfamiliar!

### Day 11: April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: ARKit, iOS

**Thoughts**: Most of my coding knowledge stems from the fantastic people over at the [London App Brewery](https://www.londonappbrewery.com/) and their courses continue to inspire me. I seriously considered using ARKit as my "new tech" piece to incorporate into my capstone project, but ended up ditching the idea because I would want to spend more than a work week delving into it. I got my little fix by rendering a 3d Hogwarts Express onto my illustrated copy of The Sorceror's/Philospher's Stone!

### Day 10: April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Python

**Thoughts**: Getting more reps in a Python code challenge today. This is a great exercise to translate our JS thinking into Python and making it into a useful language in our coding toolbox.

### Day 9: April 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Django REST Framework with with Token Authentication

**Thoughts**: Why is creating a virtual environment so confusing in Django? It's the startproject to startapp I suppose. But the difference between the UI backend with DRF versus Django monolith is _chef's kiss_ perfection. Then add the auth tokens, and that set up was so much quicker than configuring models, viewsets, and urls.

### Day 8: April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript

**Thoughts**: A simple CodeWars multiplying kata to keep my vanilla JavaScript skills fresh. Been trying to get into the headspace of proposing my capstone project on Friday, and I want to keep going with React Native and maybe tap into some Google Maps API and Firebase...

### Day 7: April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Django Views and Templating

**Thoughts**: For our hack-week project presentations, my classmates took the initiative to learn new tech! This morning we saw open-source contributors, Three.js, Docker.io, AWS Lambda, Angular.js, cURL, Phaser.io... more to come tomorrow! We dived into the Create and Read for Django views and templating -- which reminds me a lot of some EJS templating I learned a few months ago.

### Day 6: April 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React Native

**Thoughts**: The work-life balance is really testing my limits today. Hack Week project is due tomorrow at 7am PDT (10am EDT) and I had to lower my personal standards to have something solid to submit. Distractions come naturally in life. I found myself actively grounding my nerves and reminding myself that our instructors wanted this project to be done in a safe, learning environment, and that they weren't expecting perfection this time around.

### Day 5: April 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React Native

**Thoughts**: The people who make the time to create Udemy tutorials is like Boss Level 100 status. You definitely have to weed out the flubs, but the ones that have great substance are gold. I'm the type to benefit from structure and knowing how the language is implemented in the "real world" so this defintely puts my nerves at ease for the remaining two days left of Hack Week.

### Day 4: April 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Django

**Thoughts**: Are we really learning four new languages/frameworks this week? I guess we are! Made some progress on my Hack Week project. We're having guests over this weekend, so there will definitely be the challenge of work-life balance in the next few days.

### Day 3: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Python

**Thoughts**: Project 3 week ended the day before I committed to the 100 days of code, so my brain needed some time to switch gears into python. We started today off in class with Python coding challenges and I can feel the gears warming up and getting into motion! Like any new language, I'm gonna need time and my noise cancelling headphones to lock in and concentrate.

### Day 2: April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React Native

**Thoughts**: New language, who dis? React Native's home page boasts "Learn once, write anywhere" so I'm pretty excited to get this knowledge in my toolbox and get to the point where I can call myself not only a React Native developer, but a mobile app developer! Now, how do I get started?

### Day 0/1: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Committing to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Let's get it!!

**Thoughts**: One hundred days does seem pretty daunting, especially since life is in so much flux right now, but like any muscle to flex -- this will be all worth it in the end. Python, who? I don't know her. But I will!
