# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React Native

**Thoughts**: New language, who dis? React Native's home page boasts "Learn once, write anywhere" so I'm pretty excited to get this knowledge in my toolbox and get to the point where I can call myself not only a React Native developer, but a mobile app developer! Now, how do I get started?

### Day 0: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Committing to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Let's get it!!

**Thoughts**: One hundred days does seem pretty daunting, especially since life is in so much flux right now, but like any muscle to flex -- this will be all worth it in the end. Python, who? I don't know her. But I will!
