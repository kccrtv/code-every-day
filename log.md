# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript

**Thoughts**: A simple CodeWars multiplying kata to keep my vanilla JavaScript skills fresh. Been trying to get into the headspace of proposing my capstone project on Friday, and I want to keep going with React Native and maybe tap into some Google Maps API and Firebase...

### Day 7: April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Django Views and Templating

**Thoughts**: For our hack-week project presentations, my classmates took the initiative to learn new tech! This morning we saw open-source contributors, Three.js, Docker.io, AWS Lambda, Angular.js, cURL, Phaser.io... more to come tomorrow! We dived into the Create and Read for Django views and templating -- which reminds me a lot of some EJS templating I learned a few months ago.

### Day 6: April 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React Native

**Thoughts**: The work-life balance is really testing my limits today. Hack Week project is due tomorrow at 7am PDT (10am EDT) and I had to lower my personal standards to have something solid to submit. Distractions come naturally in life. I found myself actively grounding my nerves and reminding myself that our instructors wanted this project to be done in a safe, learning environment, and that they weren't expecting perfection this time around.

### Day 5: April 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React Native

**Thoughts**: The people who make the time to create Udemy tutorials is like Boss Level 100 status. You definitely have to weed out the flubs, but the ones that have great substance are gold. I'm the type to benefit from structure and knowing how the language is implemented in the "real world" so this defintely puts my nerves at ease for the remaining two days left of Hack Week.

### Day 4: April 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Django

**Thoughts**: Are we really learning four new languages/frameworks this week? I guess we are! Made some progress on my Hack Week project. We're having guests over this weekend, so there will definitely be the challenge of work-life balance in the next few days.

### Day 3: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Python

**Thoughts**: Project 3 week ended the day before I committed to the 100 days of code, so my brain needed some time to switch gears into python. We started today off in class with Python coding challenges and I can feel the gears warming up and getting into motion! Like any new language, I'm gonna need time and my noise cancelling headphones to lock in and concentrate.

### Day 2: April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React Native

**Thoughts**: New language, who dis? React Native's home page boasts "Learn once, write anywhere" so I'm pretty excited to get this knowledge in my toolbox and get to the point where I can call myself not only a React Native developer, but a mobile app developer! Now, how do I get started?

### Day 0/1: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Committing to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Let's get it!!

**Thoughts**: One hundred days does seem pretty daunting, especially since life is in so much flux right now, but like any muscle to flex -- this will be all worth it in the end. Python, who? I don't know her. But I will!
